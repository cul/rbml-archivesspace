The Harvard Excel import pluginis now installed on Columbia’s three ArchivesSpace instances. The plugin allows bulk import of archival objects for finding aid creation, as well as bulk digital object addition. 

There are three versions of the Excel template for importing archival objects; a full version with no columns hidden, a moderate version with many columns hidden; and a light version with most columns hidden. 

The file named digital_object_aspace_import_excel_template_cul.xslx is the default Excel template for creating and linking digital objects to existing archival description.

Click the link on the file name, and then click “download” to download the spreadsheet.

The CUL manual for using the plugin is a Google doc found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bNmp5s0RxJPMKbVrdUp_X4nZgzwmGdLyvc4Ht1wyf84/edit#heading=h.ywv3bvhivgj8
